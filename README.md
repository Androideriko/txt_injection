# txt_injection
Exploitating a demo application with a injected "\n" parameter malfunctioning the weak password saving security.

I am sorry if the desingn will look nice at all because I used a mac and from what I know it could
look quite different on you'r other OS(windows, linux...).

I used python3 so if you are using an older version of python and there are some issues try running it
in python3 or higher.

To run the code you have to run the "socket_server.py" first and then the "Mount_etna... .py".
If you don't want to run the code on localhost just change the IP to the ip you want to use on both python codes(but
you most probably know all of that).

I had the build the application for school but than I found this tiny little voulnerability and tried to exploit it, and
it worked(at least for me)!
